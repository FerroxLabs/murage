# Ubuntu Desktop

OpenMausBot has an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS x86_64 desktop beta. The Electron package embeds the harness server, so
installed builds do not require Node, pnpm, Swift, or a terminal at runtime. For giving a bot the same kind
of Linux desktop on your own server instead of this machine, see [byo-vps.md](byo-vps.md).

## What works

- The native Electron window and embedded OpenMausBot server on GNOME Xorg and GNOME Wayland.
- Local Claude, Codex, Grok, Gemini, and other configured agent CLIs.
- Chat, streaming turns, approvals, bot-to-bot communication, and local data storage.
- Composio connected apps and Box cloud computers.
- External documentation and OAuth links in the default browser.
- An explicit, view-only local screen preview on GNOME Xorg and GNOME Wayland. The Wayland path uses the
  native portal chooser and keeps the selected PipeWire stream open until the user stops sharing.

The local preview does **not** give the bot control of this computer. Linux dictation and local computer
control remain unavailable and fail closed in the Electron, server, and UI layers. Use a Cloud box when a bot
needs a computer it can act on. Xorg computer control, Wayland automation, bundled CUA, dictation, and ARM64
are follow-ups in [issue #29](https://github.com/milind-soni/OpenMausBot/issues/29).

## Build packages

Requirements for building from source:

- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS x86_64
- Node.js 24 or newer
- pnpm 10.33.0 (Corepack can install the version declared by the project)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/milind-soni/OpenMausBot.git
cd OpenMausBot
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm package:linux
```

The build creates:

- `release/OpenMausBot-<version>-amd64.deb`
- `release/OpenMausBot-<version>-x86_64.AppImage`

The AppImage uses a static runtime and does not require the legacy `libfuse2` package.

## Install and run

Install the Debian package with APT so its desktop dependencies are resolved:

```sh
sudo apt install ./release/OpenMausBot-*-amd64.deb
```

Then open **OpenMausBot** from the GNOME application launcher. To remove it:

```sh
sudo apt remove openmausbot
```

The portable AppImage does not install system files:

```sh
chmod +x release/OpenMausBot-*-x86_64.AppImage
./release/OpenMausBot-*-x86_64.AppImage
```

Application data remains local in `~/.openmausbot`. Electron browser data and window state use the normal XDG
configuration directory (`~/.config/openmausbot` unless the environment overrides it).

## Develop the desktop shell

Development mode uses three processes. Keep each command running in its own terminal:

```sh
pnpm dev:server
pnpm dev
pnpm dev:desktop
```

For a package-shaped build without creating `.deb` or AppImage artifacts:

```sh
pnpm package:linux:dir
./release/linux-unpacked/openmausbot
```

## Agent CLI discovery

Applications launched from GNOME do not inherit the same interactive shell `PATH` as a terminal. OpenMausBot
keeps the inherited path and adds existing common locations such as:

- `~/.local/bin`
- `~/.claude/local`
- `~/.volta/bin`
- `~/.bun/bin`
- `~/.asdf/shims`
- `~/.deno/bin`
- `~/.nvm/versions/node/*/bin`
- `/usr/local/bin`

It also probes the login shell in the background. If a CLI still is not detected, set an explicit additional
path before launching the app from a terminal and verify it there:

```sh
OMB_EXTRA_PATH=/your/custom/bin ./release/OpenMausBot-*-x86_64.AppImage
```

Restart OpenMausBot after installing or signing in to a CLI.

## Xorg and Wayland

The shell, chat, cloud computers, connected apps, and preview-only capture work in both GNOME session types.
The Wayland chooser/select/persistent-stream/cancel/end/retry lifecycle has been validated in a real Ubuntu
24.04 GNOME Wayland session. OpenMausBot detects Wayland before XWayland when both `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` and
`DISPLAY` exist, so capture cannot accidentally bypass portal-mediated behavior.

Open the Computer panel and use the separate **Preview this computer** card. Capture never starts when the app
or panel opens.

- **Xorg:** **Start preview** captures the primary monitor directly.
- **Wayland:** **Choose a screen** opens the GNOME portal chooser once. The selected stream stays open until
  you press **Stop preview**, close the panel, end sharing from GNOME, or quit the app.

Cancelling or ending Wayland sharing returns to a calm **Try again** state and never reopens the chooser
automatically. OpenMausBot does not capture screen audio, remember the selected monitor after restart, or
offer an **Open Settings** action on Linux.

Local computer control remains disabled on both session types in this beta. Future Xorg support will require a
validated `cua-driver`; Wayland support will remain disabled until the exact GNOME/Mutter action surface has
real capture, input, scaling, permission, and lifecycle evidence.

## Validate a package change

```sh
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm check:electron
pnpm package:linux
node scripts/verify-linux-package.mjs
dbus-run-session -- xvfb-run -a node scripts/smoke-linux-package.mjs
```

The verifier checks `.deb` metadata, desktop identity, resources, artifact permissions, and the absence of
unsupported native binaries. The smoke test launches the unpacked production app without `--no-sandbox`,
validates the renderer/preload capabilities and embedded health endpoint, then proves clean shutdown. It is not
a substitute for manual testing on a real GNOME Xorg and Wayland desktop.

## Troubleshooting

### An agent CLI is missing

Run the CLI directly in a terminal, finish its sign-in flow, then restart OpenMausBot. If it lives outside the
common directories above, use `OMB_EXTRA_PATH` while testing and report the install location so it can be
considered for automatic discovery.

### A bot needs computer tools

Choose **Cloud box** in the Computer panel and add a Box token in App Settings. **This computer** is disabled on
Linux until local CUA control is implemented and validated.

### Screen preview does not start

On Xorg, confirm the session has an active display with `echo "$XDG_SESSION_TYPE"`; it should print `x11`.
On Wayland, confirm `xdg-desktop-portal` and the GNOME portal backend are running, then click **Try again** to
open a new chooser. Cancelling or stopping sharing never causes an automatic second prompt.

### The AppImage does not start

Confirm the executable bit and architecture:

```sh
chmod +x OpenMausBot-*-x86_64.AppImage
file OpenMausBot-*-x86_64.AppImage
```

Run it from a terminal once to collect the startup output. Do not install `libfuse2` just for this AppImage; the
package is built with the static runtime.
